## Chapter 1 â€“ Project Context  

### 2. Project Context  
With the fast growth of mobile technology, apps are now used for learning and personal growth. Many children and students prefer interactive and fun tools instead of traditional reading. In Christian education, there are still few apps that make Bible learning enjoyable and engaging.  

The project **Faith Fun Time: An Interactive Bible Learning Mobile App** aims to fill this gap. It offers Bible stories, quizzes, and daily inspirational verses in one platform. The app is safe, ad-free, and designed to help both children and adults enjoy and learn from the Bible in a modern way.  

### 3. Statement of the Problem  
Even though there are many Bibles and study guides available, children and youth often lose interest because the materials are not interactive. They are more attracted to games and other apps that are not faith-based.  

Problems identified:  
- Few apps focus on interactive Bible learning.  
- Lack of games and quizzes that make learning fun.  
- Young users get distracted by secular apps.  
- Technology is not fully used in Christian education.  

This is why there is a need for a mobile app that makes Bible study more fun, engaging, and meaningful.
